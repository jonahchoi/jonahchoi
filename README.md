- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jonahchoi
- I am an aspiring software engineer/web developer learning Javascript and it's libraries in order to reach my goals.
- I have always been a man of science and I love all sorts of technology. So what better to pursue than computer science! 
- I am particularly interested in React and building unique websites.
- Started my learning on freeCodeCamp's Javascript courses, but I still have a lot to learn so let's do it together!
